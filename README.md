# learning_statistics
Playground for coding up statistical tests.

## To Do:
   
      1. Refactor so that classes have an attribute that declares whether Z-, t-, F-test, chisquare-test, which the PValue class should use to determine appropriate table. Make PValue determination an attribute of each statistic class.

      2. Add plot as attribute to each statistic class.
